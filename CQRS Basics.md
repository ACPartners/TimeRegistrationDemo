# Command Query Responsibility Segregation Pattern

## Introduction

Basic principle for this pattern is that we want to separate the way we query data and modify data.

Based upon this pattern you could go even further with [Event Sourceing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)

## Practical in our demo

TODO

We will not use event sourcing in our example. ( Why? When should you use it? Discussion)
